# Introduction

Tennis, original known as Lawn Tennis, was invented in 1873 by Londoner Major Walter Wingfield. The first grand slam, Wimbledon was held in United Kingdom (UK) in the year 1877. The final was played between Spencer Gore and William Marshall. Spencer Gore, a tennis player from UK won the first grand slam.
 
Tennis is a racquet sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (Singles) or between two teams of two players each (Doubles). In a tournament, there are mainly Men's Singles, Men's Doubles, Women's Singles, Women's Doubles and Mixed Doubles. 


# Rules of Tennis

-	A ball must land within bounds for play to continue, if a player hits the ball outside of bounds, this results in the loss of the point for them.
-	Players/teams cannot touch the net or posts or cross onto the opponent's side nor hit the ball twice.
- Players/teams cannot carry the ball or catch it with the racquet.
- Players cannot hit the ball twice.
-	Players must wait until the ball passes the net before they return it.
- A player that does not return a live ball before it bounces twice loses the point.
- If the ball hits or touches the players, that counts as a penalty.
- If the racquet leaves the hand or verbal abuse occurs, a penalty is given.
- Any ball that bounces on the lines of boundary are considered good.
-	A serve must bounce first before the receiving player can return it.

## Point - Game - Set - Match

- **Point**: Starting at love (0 points), points increment from 15-30-40-Game.

- **Game**: A game consist of 4 points, as the leading player has at-least a 2 point advantage.

- **Set**: A set is won when a player wins 6 games with a lead of at-least 2 games.

- **Match**: Whichever player/team wins the majority of sets win the match. Generally an odd number ( 3 or 5 sets).

- **Advantage Set**: If a game score of 6-6 is reached and advantage set rules are used, a player/team can only win a set with a 2 game lead.

- **Deuce**: Occurs if a score of 40-40 is reached. In order to win the game, a player/team must win 2 consecutive points in order to take the game. If a player wins one point, they have advantage, but if they lose the next point, the score returns to deuce.

- **Tie-break game**: If a game score of 6-6 is reached and tie-break set rules are used, players must play a tie-break game in order to decide who wins the set. In a tie-break game, a player/team must reach 7 points with a two point advantage to win. For the serving format of a tie-break game, player 1 serves for the first point, player 2 serves for the next two points, player 1 serves for the next two points after that, etc.

## Equipment

- **Racquet**: A racquet is comprised of a handle, a frame, and strings that are bound in a crisscross weaving pattern. A racquet’s frame should not exceed 32 inches in length, with a handle no longer than 12.5 inches in width, and a surface no more than 15.5 inches in overall length or 11.5 inches in width. There can also be no objects or devices on the racquet except for ones that prevent vibration and wear and tear.

- **Ball**: A tennis ball is white or yellow in color for tournaments, with measurements of 2-1/2 to 2-5/8 inches in diameter and weighing anywhere from 2 to 2-1/16 ounces. The elasticity of the ball and the uniform outer surface are also determined by approved specifications.
